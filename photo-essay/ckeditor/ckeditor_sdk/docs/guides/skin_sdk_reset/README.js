This means that the skin can have interference from external CSS\npresent on the page.</p>\n\n<p>Let's suppose a site likes red links. By simply adding\n<code>a{color:red;}</code> in a CSS file would be enough to make the toolbar\nlabels or dialog tabs of the editor red.</p>\n\n<p>To workaround this problem, a skin developer must include \"reset styles\" that\nwill define defaults for most of the styles that could impact on the editor\ninterface. Check the <code>reset.css</code> file in the\n<a href=\"#!/guide/skin_sdk_intro-section-2\">Moono skin</a>. It is a useful base for it.</p>\n","title":"CSS Reset","meta_description":"Information about resetting default CSS styles.","meta_keywords":"ckeditor, editor, wysiwyg, skin, skins, tutorial, sample, sdk, example, development, css, reset, style, stylesheet"});
