That's because the skin itself\ndefined where and how to use colors.</p>\n\n<p>For that purpose, the <code>CKEDITOR.skin.chameleon</code> function must be\ndefined in the <code>skin.js</code> file. Please check the\n<a href=\"#!/guide/skin_sdk_intro-section-2\">Moono skin</a> files for full details.</p>\n\n<p>Note that adopting this feature is totally optional. A skin developer may decide\nto have a fixed color and not give the possibility to change it. Of course we\ndonâ€™t recommend this, but if that is the case, it is enough to not defined the\nchameleon function in the <code>skin.js</code> file.</p>\n","title":"\"Chameleon\" Feature","meta_description":"Information about CKEditor \"chameleon\" feature.","meta_keywords":"ckeditor, editor, wysiwyg, skin, skins, tutorial, sample, sdk, example, development, chameleon, color, colour, ui, interface"});
