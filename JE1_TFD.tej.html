The word "otherwise" means "if al else fails", which is an example of &nbsp;exaggeration when the completely avoidable does happen. Next, the word "unremarkable" used with "otherwise" is an example of hyperbole as the otherwise inevitably remarkable day is not remarkable, since she had a loss for words. Next, the word "ashamed" shows something that usually does not happen: being ashamed of a parent.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
