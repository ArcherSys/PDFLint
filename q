' We've hired black reporters, but they won't stay. We have a minority intern program,and we've been doing positive sqqqqqqqqqqqtories on minnorities. Last we had that profile of the black who got the Teacher of the Year Award--'" (Hatter 122)</p></td><td><p>&nbsp;This quote is something big: it shows that the newsapaper is doing something great in the community to help minorities become better newspaper writers; and they said positive stories on minorities to show they care about minorities. But it shows another thing:they are not like television news stations today, who almost don't care about minorities. The ifference between the Today show and the Fort Lewis Times is that the Fort Lewis Times has small town values that&nbsp; the Today show today almost doesn't.same thing applies to positivity. To me, it's sectionalism.</p></td><td><p>Howdoes the use an allusion to show that the For Lewis Times has a heart for minorities?</p></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
