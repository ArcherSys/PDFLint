And seeing this lack of concern all of a sudden I am afraid"&nbsp;</p></td><td><p>Hyperbole, Alliteration</p></td><td><p>Jones uses hyperbole to show how careless people are at Seaton Elementary School. The words "dozens" used more than once is an example of repitition, in which can form a hyperbole when that word is referring to a plural entitie such as papers in groups of 12. the hyperbole is also followed by the word "afraid". &nbsp;What that means is that the daughter is nervous about school due to the fact that no one cared about the papers being carelessly left on the floor.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
