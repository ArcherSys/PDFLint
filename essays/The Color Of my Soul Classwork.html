<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In&nbsp;<em>The Color of My Soul</em>, Alex helped Kira find her identity by having a small&nbsp;&nbsp;dance that made her feel good inside. For example: "Kira turned up the volume, closed her asnd listened to the voices flowing with the flute &nbsp;and the pounding drums. Alex sang &nbsp;along, his voice low and melodic making sounds more than actual words that she could understand. She remebered his dancing &nbsp;and suddenly felt the urge to jump and spin to the music. As if could see her thoughts, he said he would &nbsp;teach her to dance, but she refused - immediately embarrassed..." (Hatter 140). The following quote tells the facts cold: &nbsp;"he said he would teach her to dance" is exactly how Alex help Kira. The outcome comes after this happens: "she felt the urge to jump and spin to the music". &nbsp;This qoute is how she rids the excuse she has used throught the book "but the truth is , I can't dance".</span></p></body></html>
