<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Great Depression: An Authoritative Review of The 2nd Roosevelt Administration</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; The Roosevelt administration of the 1930s and the 1940s was very different from the one of the 1910s. The Roosevelt&nbsp;adminstration in the 1930s was dealing with a tough and brutal recession called the Great Depression. The Great&nbsp;Depression was not fixed by the New Deal policies that FDR imposed. Instead, they were fixed by the worst war the world has ever known: World War II. The 2nd Roosevelt administration was not very effective in fixing the mess made after the&nbsp;stock market crash in 1929 as the New Deal, the slow&nbsp;response that Roosevelt had tried to execute to help&nbsp;African-Americans, and the socioeconomic strategies of the Roosevelt administration&nbsp;was not enough to immediately fix the mess in the 1930s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Roosevelt administration was not as effective as it was supposed to be as the New Deal policy of the Roosevelt&nbsp;adminsitration was not effective enough to have ended the Great Depression before 1940. For example Document D says&nbsp;An Enormous outpouring of federal money for human relief and immense sums for public works projects started to flow to&nbsp;all points of the compass ... Six billion dollars was added to the national debt ... " (Garrison). The preceding source&nbsp;showed that the New Deal was not the solution to the problem that the country was having at the time as there was 6&nbsp;billion dollars added to the national debt. The debt showed that there was more trouble when these programs were&nbsp;implemented, and that the Second World War was what freed us through production rates that soared through the &nbsp;roof, &nbsp;along with the war bonds purchased around the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Roosevelt adminstration was also not as effective as it was supposed to be in fixing the mess from the 1929 stock market crash as they have not reached out enough to the minority who was a demographic majority and one of the best kinds of workers at the time: African Americans. For example, " At Boulder Dam, for example , the administration continued the shameful policy begun by Hoover of forbidding Negroes to live in Boulder City, the government-built town." The preceding quote shows that even though Roosevelt tried to clean up the mess that Hoover created economically and socially, the Roosevelt adminstration was slow in dealing with the mess that Hoover left in area that he has helped fund to be built, such as Boulder City or the Tennessee Valley area.</span></p>
