<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Civil war was one of the bloodiest battles in American history.The war started with the South's secession from the Union. They had gotten a new president, and actually named themselves the Confederate States of America. However, it really started with cannonfire by the Confederacy upon a supply ship from the Union (USA). The outcome of the Civil War was justified as the South did not have the resources , morale , and technology to win the war.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The outcome of the Civil War was justified as the South did not have enough resources to win the war. In Document 1, the South only had 4% weapons, 28% of railroad tracks, 14% of factories, 19% of factories and 29% of population in the original Union. The North had 96% of weapons, 72% of Railroad Tracks, 86 % of factories, and 71% of the two countries combined. The only thing the south did have that the north did not was cotton. This shows that the South did not have enough weapons to defeat the Union as much as the North did, as well as the funds. Furthermore, in Document 3, Maj. General George B. McClellan requests a blockade of the atlantic ocean , in which affected the economy of the South by shutting it out of getting more resources.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The outcome of the civil war also was justified as the South did not have enough&nbsp;&nbsp;morale to win the war. According to Document 4, the South had only 2/3 of the Union's amount o morale, which was 1,082,119 out of 1,556,678 troops. The document also says that the death rate for the Confederacy was 24 percent, while the death rate for the Union was 23 percent. The Confederacy&nbsp;should have won as everyone would think. However, the Union had more morale to where they could win, a whopping 1,556,678 soldiers. Furthermore, according to Document 2, the South did attack the North many times, more than the North attacked the South. This shows that the South lost morale during those battles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The outcome of the civil war was also justified as the South also lacked the technology to win the war.According to Document 5, the first ironclad gunboat, the Saint Louis was made in the Union. this&nbsp;&nbsp;document shows that the South lacked the resources needed to achieve&nbsp;this technological advancement.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Outcome of the civil war was justified by the South's lack&nbsp;of resources, morale, and technology. The South had a blockade problem, which kept it from getting more resources from foreign lands, a morale problem, which caused it to loe the war, and a technology problem, which caused the number of Confederate prisoners of war to rise.</span></p>
