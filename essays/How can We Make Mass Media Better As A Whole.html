<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 14pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We talked about how Mass Media is neccessary for the people as a whole. However, It seems useless to some. So, we area going to make Mass Media better withthe following reforms. We as a whole can make Mass Media better by doing the following: Add Journalism Classes, Using Mass Media to create a school newspaper, and showing the student's work by displaying it on the screen that the school provides each classroom.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 14pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mass Media can be made better by adding actual journalism classes. These classes are very useful for studets who want to be actual journalists as it gives mass media journalists to become what it wants to become. The use of Mass Media can also revolutionize the way we convey information intramurally. That is, through a school newpaper. Furthermore, they ( the mass media students) will also be ready for the big corporations of the news world: NBC, ABC, CBS, and FOX. If they are good cameramen, then they will be part of those corporations as well as being part of a bigger group: the team that operates the Mass Media Jumbotron. Mass Media can bring the fame straight to the person at their job if the proper classes are planned for the years to come.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 14pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mass Media can be also made better by adding a school newspaper in the mix. The school newpaper will have two major activities running it: The school newspaper team, and the classes of all the mass media teachers. the newspaper could&nbsp;be interesting enough to where it could turn MTHS from a STEM school to a STEAM school ( you need cartoonists to do the comics section of the newspaper). IT could also help out the Mass Media STEM Track by setting up a special Wordpress site on Cloud9 to help with the creation of an online version of the school newspaper. The thing that also can be started if the school newspaper is successful is the consolidation of &nbsp;the school's STEM&nbsp;journal&nbsp;and the MTHS Library Magazine into one big happy family. these magazine come out every week depending on the content released , and the period of the release. The newspaper could also help the Engineering stem track by allowing them to design their very own newspaper stand or rack using a 3D printer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 14pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally , Mass Media can also be made better by allowing the high scoring porjects of the cameramen (Mass Media students who learn how to be cameramen) to be displayed on the Mass Media Jumbotron, or Mass Media TV screen The Mass Media Jumbotron, like the IT Jumbotron , is black and a little small for a jumbotron, but it is very useful for things like displaying work and more. It is not about just doing it online and in print: The Mass Media Jumbotron can be used for displaying a slideshow of successful &nbsp;newspaper articles, and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 14pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To conclude, Mass Media should be made better using the following reforms: more journalism courses for students who want to become more than a person who took Mass Media, &nbsp;a school newspaper for the practice of this skill in a better way than normal, and the use of their jumbotron for news, slideshows of succesful articles , and more. It's not "Why Mass Media?"; It's &nbsp;"Why&nbsp;the same old, same old?".</span></p></body></html>
