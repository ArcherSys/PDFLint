<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Have you ever had a dream that was ever &ldquo;deferred&rdquo; ?The Langston Hughes poem may</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> have some truth for when Engineering tries to make Mass Media a thing past.There are many benefits that could </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">be true for people who take Mass Media as a STEM Track. Many of our 9<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;graders will or have&nbsp;had this </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">experience before.&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason Mass Media exists and should exist is as it is created to help us become better </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">journalists, better bloggers, and better writers in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mass Media STEM Track would make excellent journalists if salvaged. Mass Media is the </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">practice or art of getting media and information to the masses for good use and for notification in case it is </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">serious (breaking news). Mass Media can help those students who take this STEM track seriously get into other </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">fields of study such as meteorology or sports analysis. Mass Media also can help those students find internships</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> that they could never have: WRC&nbsp;for the summer, WJLA&nbsp;for the summer, WTTG&nbsp;or the summer, or WUSA for the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> summer. That is a big help whe you want to become a journalist.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Mass Media STEM Track should and does exist to make students who take that STEM</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Track into &nbsp;better bloggers. I remember when I was in Summer Bridge in 2012. That time I had learned about </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">many Mass Media concepts, such as blogging and writing in the journalistic sense. The thing about Mass Media is </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">that it makes you a better blogger, Tweeter and &nbsp;a better journalist. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mass Media also makes &nbsp;you a better blogger. As I said before , I have learned about blogging in </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Summer Bridge, along with the concepts of making successful blog posts for many people. A blog post can be </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">seen by many people if they have lots of followers and a popular hashtag. The also are blogging in other big</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> ways to the masses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mass Media STEM Track can also make better writers. For example: Mass Media students can</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> interview, write editorials, news features and more. &nbsp;These students were taught this to make them better </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">writers, and better at gathering information for biographies, esaays, reasearch papers and more. The thing about</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Mass Media is that it can help&nbsp;start a really good stem journal provided the students writing it have the proper </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">journalistic skills to do it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mass Media STEM Track should not be erradicated as it provides students the journalistic </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">skills that can make them better writers, bloggers, and journalists. So, Mr. Lesley, pleason don't defer the </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">dreams of many freshmen and incoming freshmen. &nbsp;If you want to make our school better, why</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> &nbsp;not make that STEM Track run the school newspaper, a TV Station, or a online newspaper? With IT helping Mass</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Media, there could be a special WordPress site for that very purpose.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
