<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Have you ever had a dream that was ever &ldquo;deferred&rdquo;? The Langston Hughes poem may have some truth for when Engineering tries to make Mass Media a thing past. There are many benefits that could be true for people who take Mass Media as a STEM Track. Many of our 9th&nbsp;and 10th&nbsp;graders will or have&nbsp;had this experience before.&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason Mass Media exists and should exist is as it is created to help us become better journalists, better bloggers, and better writers in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mass Media STEM Track would make excellent journalists if salvaged. Mass Media is the practice or art of getting media and information to the masses for good use and for notification in case it is serious (breaking news). Mass Media can help those students who take this STEM track seriously get into other fields of study such as meteorology or sports analysis. Mass Media also can help those students find internships that they could never have: WRC&nbsp;for the summer, WJLA&nbsp;for the summer, WTTG&nbsp;or the summer, or WUSA for the summer. That is a big help when you want to become a journalist.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;"> Mass Media also can &nbsp;make you into a much &nbsp;better blogger as well as a better writer . I remember when I was in Summer Bridge in 2012. That time I had learned about many Mass Media concepts, such as blogging and writing in the journalistic sense. The thing about Mass Media is that it makes you a better blogger, mini-blogger&nbsp;and a better journalist, along with the fact that it can teach you the concepts of making successful blog posts for many people. A blog post can be seen by many people if they have lots of followers and a popular hash tag. They also are blogging in other big ways to the masses. But a blog post&nbsp;For example: Mass Media students can interview, write editorials, news features and more. &nbsp;These students were taught this to make them better writers, and better at gathering information for biographies, essays, research papers and more. The thing about Mass Media is that it can help&nbsp;start a really good stem journal provided the students writing it have the proper journalistic skills to do it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Mass Media STEM Track should not be eradicated as it provides students the journalistic skills that can make them better writers, bloggers, and journalists. So, Mr. Lesley, please don't defer the dreams of many freshmen and incoming freshmen. &nbsp;If you want to make our school better, why not make that STEM Track run the school newspaper, a TV Station, or an online newspaper? With IT helping Mass Media, there could be a special WordPress site for that very purpose.&nbsp;</span></p></body></html>
