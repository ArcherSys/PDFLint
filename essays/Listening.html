<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-size: 14pt;">To speak to the public, one must be able to listen to anyone to develop understanding, background knowledge, and credibility that makes that speaker credible.&nbsp;</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;"> First, one&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">must be able &nbsp;to understand&nbsp;their &nbsp;audience.&nbsp;If the speaker doesn't understand the audience, then they don't have the wisdom&nbsp;they think they they have. To have wisdom, as I&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">learned from my assistant scoutmaster, one must &nbsp;first listen to the person&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">that is talking, and then they have to think about what</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 14pt;">the person said means. Then, you have to have gone through, or experienced whatever the person has gone through &nbsp;in order to get prior knowledge of what it is like to be in their shoes. After you experience what they have experienced, &nbsp;then you&nbsp;have wisdom, or what they have gone through.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Second, one must be able to have background knowledge on their subject in order to know what they are talking about in public speaking. For example, when Shahed Chowdhuri taught us C# and unity basics at the Microsoft internship, he didn't just talk about C#; he had to do lots of research and actually WORK for Microsoft in order to be able to publicly speak about programming in C#. Another good example: When I would talk about having learned more than 10 programming languages, that isn't just talk; &nbsp;I have read many books and docs on them, while there are products I have made that show my integrity. But he may have had to also listen to a higher-up from the past that &nbsp;knew C# from the past as well as do research So presentations and learning make a big difference in whether or not a person has a good sense of ethos.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, to speak to the public, one must have credibility in order to be able to publicly speak to anyone. For example, to show wisdom, one&nbsp;has to have listened to be credible, otherwise he has nothing on what he is talking about. In other words , you don't fake wisdom, as that shows you have no credibility. However, it is not just shown through listening; it is also shown through actions. However, those actions require someone to listen to what an educator is saying in &nbsp;a class as you cannot make a project that involves a rubric that has to be reviewed ,many times without listening first as you will miss key warnings that could spare you some grade points that could have been taken off for just one avoidable mistake.When it comes to group work, it makes more sense to listen to your project manager than not to when presenting your team's work as the project manager has more experience in working in a team for his field of work whether video game design or software development. So, &nbsp;in the real world, all of these situations come into play in terms of public speaking requiring the ability to listen.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To recap, one must listen before speaking in public as when they listen they develop a better understanding of the audience that could turn&nbsp;into useful wisdom on that topic. Second, they should listen before speaking in public as they need background knowledge, in which may be acquired only from lectures where listening is key to retaining the information they need. Finally, one should listen before speaking as when they listen to more experienced people, they gain credibility when they turn the listening into actions, which exhibit credibility with the most efficacy. The catch is &nbsp;that you &nbsp;have to do your homework before you can become valedictorian, as valedictorians have to listen to lectures, and they &nbsp;have to listen out for any homework assignments like anyone else, not to mention they may have to listen to other important information in order to be able to get help and access resources that can help them in the future.&nbsp;</span></span></p></body></html>
