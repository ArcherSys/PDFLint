"It was - it was -" She closed her eyes and pursed her lips. The silence expanded, preparing to pop. "'It was you father.'"(Hatter 11).</p></td><td><p>This piece of text shows one thing - the truth was the opposite of what Kira's mother had told her when she was younger. The similarities between my father and her father are that they weren't in any of our lives, 2) they both get seen later in the years, and 3) they disappear for a long time at some point. I can also relate to Kira's views of her father after seeing him as I too, thought he and his side of the family was something I somewhat strongly disliked for abandoning my mother. However I have technically lost contact with the Pipers and , but luckily I retained their address to memeory after two years.
