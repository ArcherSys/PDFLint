<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Dear Tea Monea, &nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am unexpectedly writing this letter to you right now to inform you that we unfortunately have come to an end of an era. Be aware that I thought this over many times, and rationally came up with a conclusion to avoid breaking your heart. As of today, I will not be going out to prom with you due to many factors. The three main factors are grades, the need to avoid the practice of cheating, and the fact that this relationship has ran its course.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The first reason for ending this relationship is due to our grades. Our grades are very&nbsp;different than what they were beforehand. My GPA last year was equivalent to yours ,but a bit higher to get NHS. I understand that this greatly affects you, but I want to go out to prom with someone who has the same GPA as me so we both benefit from the relationship, and not get into some serious Win-Lose or Lose-Win trouble to where someone doesn't make it back to be anyone's prom date next year due to them being statistically expelled (uninvited). If I have to keep my grades up to stay here, then I have to do it with somebody with the same GPA so we get out of this together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The second &nbsp;reason I have to break up with you is the fact that I am in danger of getting my reputation&nbsp;tarnished by a rumor accidentally started by Mr. Hill. Mr. Hill thought I was cheating on you and Nadjah Watkins. However, that is not the case. I was intending to transition to a better relationship where I would be with someone just like me, and not someone who is very different to where the relationship runs its course long before a prom king even gets elected. So I asked her out, and I seven wrote a letter for you in advance so you would know what was going on before hell breaks loose on both sides of the equation. I know , I should have told you the truth and though about it before saying yes to this relationship.But I was too gullible. However, Mr. Hill told Mr. Springer, so I have to end this relationship before all hell does break loose, and it will do it very severely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The third reason is due to the fact that this relationship has ran its course. I realized that there are many rumors about you in terms of other guys. I doubt it, but I also realized that there aren't enough similarities between us to continue. First, we are living very different lives. I 'm in the worst predicament right now. You are in the best predicament. We barely know anything similar about each other. That is the problem right now. &nbsp;Dating is not about luck. It's about positive comparisons and similarities. It's about the heart, compassion, empathy, teamwork. It's about truth, courage, sacrifice, passion, and doing what is right for each other. I'm trying to go out with Nadjah for a reason: to end &nbsp;the&nbsp;social structure in this school that involves pariahs, and replace that structure with one that has no pariahs at all, period. I feel bad that Nadjah deals with being dissed by people like Jasmine Hill, and when you did that, I felt a little mad at you for doing that. But I never let that determine whether I would break up with you. So I let that handwritten letter get undelivered until something happened. That happened yesterday, and now I have to act upon what happened in the most unexpected way possible. You see, when I accidentally cheated on Nia Crawford's friend Zach (it's a she), she broke up with me. I did not know that I cheated until she told me, and I learned my lesson from that day forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The three main reasons why I have to break up with you were my failing&nbsp;grades, the need to avoid the practice of cheating, and the blandness of this relationship. I understand how you feel right now. I should have told you the truth about continuing this relationship from the beginning. However , I did not want to break your heart, and I realized that could be the case If I don't help clean up the mess. So , I have decided to the following acts of kindness for you to start over with a strong start. First, I will help you find a new prom date and partner. I will go looking all over the school for any junior that is male If you don't like my recommendation. My recommendation is Muhammed Johnson. This guy I feel bad for as well as he always gets hammered by the harsh words of the admins. I am in the same boat as he is as I have not only have had my dream software showcase event canceled more that twice by admins (despite the fact that it was never designed to be malice), they also are now a flight risk with the accident of a rumor as I now have to end this relationship to stop the spread of that rumor, so we understand each other. I have seen you guys interact pretty well with each other, so you would both be pretty good partners. If you don't want him to be your partner, let me know. The second thing I will do is help you with your homework. I am doing the same thing with Nadjah, as I don't want to be uninvited to where I will never see her again. This techinque is called Win-Win. If you join my study group, then maybe you, me, and Nadjah will make it hopefully to the Principal's List .That is my goal. To remember me in a positive way, think of all the &nbsp; good things I did for you, and leave the rest behind.Think of me as "The Ex who cared for his Ex". Au revoir, Tea. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">With the most sincerity and empathy,</span></p>
